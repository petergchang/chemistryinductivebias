# Overview

This guide provides a scannable, layered map of the Computable Model of the Chemistry Textbook (CMT).

- **Goal**: a reusable information architecture that we keep returning to.
- **Two organizing axes**: Layers (higher → mid → lower) and Conceptual categories.

## Key components at a glance

- **Process**: enumerate transformations → compute properties → score candidates → aggregate.
- **Object rules**: formal charge, electronegativity, resonance, atomic radius, inductive effects.
- **Parameters**: weights, score map, thresholds, inductive hyperparameters.
- **Artifacts**: transformations, components, mechanism products, diagnostics.

See the subsequent pages for the layered view, component summaries, module deep‑dives, and hard‑parts.
