# Hard Parts

We highlight areas where the approach is novel and the information structure matters.

- **Computable textbook model**: separating structured (rules, parameters) from unstructured (chem intuition) knowledge and making the structured portion executable.
- **Layering the reasoning**: intent → architecture → mechanics keeps debates productive and repeatable.
- **Inductive effect modeling**: relative EN, distance attenuation, boosted charged centers; many tunables with clear semantics.
- **Resonance detection**: algorithmic checks for adjacency to, but not of, a π‑system; excludes direct participation in π.
- **Scoring taxonomy**: five‑level labels via `SCORE_MAP` unify disparate rules for aggregation.
- **Review loop**: forecast advisor feedback, log deltas, iterate on parameters and thresholds.

```{note}
We track “forecasts vs outcome” for feedback: negative if a missed forecast, positive if forecast and prevented, learning if unexpected.
